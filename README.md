# SpaceTourismChallenge - Attempt to complete a challenge on Frontend Mentor website using HTML, css, and Javascript
Following along Angela Yu's (Web Dev Bootcamp on Udemy) I was referred to https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3 to test what I have learned so far.
To see details of this challenge, instructions and resources available to complete it, refer to the above link still.

My SOLUTION:
My solution consists of using the resources provided to organize html files for the homepage, the "destination pages", the "crew pages" and the "technology pages".
Each of the four groups has a separate style stylesheet and script file named as follows: 
scriptHome.js & stylesHome.css - for homepage,
scriptCrew.js & stylesCrew.css,
scriptDestination.js & stylesDestination.css,
scriptTechnology.js & stylesTechnology.css

The approach adopted to overcome this challenge involved html, css, and javascript. This I call version one because it would be modified in the future using react, Sass, bootstrap and other approaches. 
The important thing for me now is to apply the knowledge so far acquired to achieve my goal.

If you are a beginner, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND you try this challenge first before adopting to watch Mr Powel and Scrmba do it. This is because in trying to do it, you read more,
learn more, and internalize the knowledge. You never will know your ability untill you test yourself.

HINTS:
Use background-color property alongside development tools in troubleshooting styling - background-color will highlight your active area at all times.
use "console.log" in dubugging scripting issues - it allows you see the output and compare real and expected outputs. 
Again, GOOGLE and YouTube will have to be your teammates in this project - you might need to learn new things as I did.
When stuck, check everything especially spellings - unfortunately, it is difficult to spot one's mistakes, getting someone else to look at it might be very useful.
You might also take a break before reattempting to spot your errors.
Finally, you need to spend much time understanding the challenge before embarking on it. With a clear sight of the end when you are starting, you would not spend
a lot of time writing codes only to discover it has to be deleted to accommodate future requirements - be consistent in using "Mobile-First" aproach or "Desktop-First.
I addopted "Mobile-First" here.

NOTE:
I chose to tweak it a little bit - my solution is not an exact match to the challenge.

Finally,
I urge you to give this a try (especially if you're a beginer) and do not give up. This is my first ever website and it took me some time and tenacity.
Wishing you good luck.
